It is conducted both in computer-based and paper-based format by IDP institutes four times a month, varying in General and Academic modules. The test is mainly required by these native English countries to allow students to migrate into the country: Canada, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand.\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                IELTS exams belong to two categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Academic IELTS<\/li>\n<li>General Training IELTS<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n                                The basic difference between the two is in the questions of their Reading and Writing modules. The questions asked in the Academic test are best suitable for anyone entering university or professional institutions. The General Training test will contain topics based on general interest.\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                No matter whether you&#8217;re new to the test or have taken the tests before but couldn&#8217;t score enough, Midas Touch is the right place to find the right people who can escort you to your dream country with your desired IELTS scores.\n                            <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n<table class='table table-striped'>\n<thead class=\"bg-primary text-white\">\n<tr>\n<th>SECTIONS<\/th>\n<th>DESCRIPTION<\/th>\n<th>APPROX TIME<\/th>\n<th>SCORES<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Writing<\/td>\n<td>2 tasks<\/td>\n<td>60 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Listening<\/td>\n<td>4 sections, 40 questions in total<\/td>\n<td>40 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading<\/td>\n<td>3 passages, each containing 13-15 questions;<br \/>40 questions in total<\/td>\n<td>60 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Speaking<\/td>\n<td>3 sections<\/td>\n<td>11-14 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n<h2 class=\"text-primary\">Reasons why we&#8217;re the best Ielts Training Institute in Ambala and Nearby Areas<\/h2>\n<p>\n                                Midas Touch offers the best-in-class Ielts training and practice programs in the region with its impeccable guidance approach and end-to-end study sessions with each student.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In-depth training and rigorous practice sessions<\/li>\n<li>Personal attention to each student due to a 10:1 student-trainer ratio<\/li>\n<li>Interactive classroom sessions with 1-on-1 group discussions on a regular basis<\/li>\n<li>Master classes by Mrs. Harmeet Kaur (22 years of experience as an IELTS trainer)<\/li>\n<li>Realistic evaluation of weekly mock tests<\/li>\n<li>Special attention to overall grammar aptitude<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"template":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/Midas\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/services\/162"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/Midas\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/services"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/Midas\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/services"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/Midas\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=162"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
