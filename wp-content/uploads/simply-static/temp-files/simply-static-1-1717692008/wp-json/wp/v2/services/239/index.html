Be mindful that a tourist visa cannot be obtained for working, studying, investing\/managing\/owning a business in, or becoming a permanent resident of a foreign country.\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                The stay period allowed for this visa is generally 30 days. Some countries may grant it for 12 months with multiple entries. However, the stay per entry is only 30 days. If your visa application meets the guidelines of the embassy, you may get the visa within a few days. However, there are factors that can contribute to a late visa: the season, the political situations, the workload on the embassy, and your home residence.\n                            <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n<h2 class=\"text-primary\">Tourist Visa Application Requirements<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tourist visa application form<\/li>\n<li>Passport with six or three months validity period<\/li>\n<li>Passport pictures<\/li>\n<li>Valid travel insurance<\/li>\n<li>Evidence of financial means<\/li>\n<li>Proof of accommodation<\/li>\n<li>Proof of a booked return flight ticket<\/li>\n<li>Proof of paid visa fee<\/li>\n<li>an Invitation letter<\/li>\n<li>Civil documents (birth certificate, marriage certificate, etc.) <\/li>\n<li>Any other supporting documents<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n<p>\n                                Once you&#8217;ve gathered all the required documents to apply for your tourist visa, you need to pay a fee (depending on the country), you will attend an interview in the related embassy along with your documents and applications.
