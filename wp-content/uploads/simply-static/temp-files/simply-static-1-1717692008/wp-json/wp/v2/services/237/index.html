Whether you&#8217;re a student, a working professional, or a permanent resident in that country, you can apply for a dependent visa for the person you want to take there along with you.\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                Depending on the country, getting a Dependent or Spouse Visa can be challenging as it requires a lot of documentation of the person in question. You also need a Dependent Certificate to prove that you are eligible to be granted a Dependent\/ Spouse Visa. This certificate mainly applies to people who are working but still need to stay with the other person for basic needs such as food and shelter.\n                            <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"images\/dependent-visa.png\" alt=\"Spouse Visa\/Dependent Visa Image\" class=\"img-fluid\"><\/p>\n<p>\n                                Imp: A dependent holding a Permanent Residence visa can work, study, or live in the country, provided he\/she must stay a permanent resident. Whereas a spouse holding a temporary dependent visa can only work for the duration according to the visa validity in most countries. However, the USA doesn&#8217;t allow that.
