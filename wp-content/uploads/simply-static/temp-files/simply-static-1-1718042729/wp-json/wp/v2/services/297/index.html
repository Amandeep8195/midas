It is conducted both in computer-based and paper-based format by IDP institutes four times a month, varying in General and Academic modules. The test is mainly required by these native English countries to allow students to migrate into the country: Canada, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand.\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                IELTS exams belong to two categories:<\/p>\n<ul class\"my-4\">\n<li>Academic IELTS<\/li>\n<li>General Training IELTS<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n                                The basic difference between the two is in the questions of their Reading and Writing modules. The questions asked in the Academic test are best suitable for anyone entering university or professional institutions. The General Training test will contain topics based on general interest.\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                No matter whether you&#8217;re new to the test or have taken the tests before but couldn&#8217;t score enough, Midas Touch is the right place to find the right people who can escort you to your dream country with your desired IELTS scores.\n                            <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab my-4\">\n<table class='table table-striped'>\n<thead class=\"bg-primary text-white\">\n<tr>\n<th>SECTIONS<\/th>\n<th>DESCRIPTION<\/th>\n<th>APPROX TIME<\/th>\n<th>SCORES<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Writing<\/td>\n<td>2 tasks<\/td>\n<td>60 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Listening<\/td>\n<td>4 sections, 40 questions in total<\/td>\n<td>40 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reading<\/td>\n<td>3 passages, each containing 13-15 questions;<br \/>40 questions in total<\/td>\n<td>60 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Speaking<\/td>\n<td>3 sections<\/td>\n<td>11-14 minutes<\/td>\n<td>0-9<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n<h2 class=\"text-primary\">Why Choose MIDAS TOUCH for IELTS Coaching in Ambala?<\/h2>\n<p>\n                                As the best IELTS coaching in Ambala city, we pride ourselves on our comprehensive and personalised approach to exam preparation.
