Unlike IELTS, this test consists of three sections: Speaking and Writing (Combined), Reading, and Listening. Another difference is that this exam is computer-based whereas IELTS is both computer- and paper-based.                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                Midas Touch aims at preparing students to take all test sections of PTE confidently by honing their 360-degree skills in the English Language.
