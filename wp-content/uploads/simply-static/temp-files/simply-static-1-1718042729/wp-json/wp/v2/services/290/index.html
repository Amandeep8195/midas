In some countries, obtaining a PR visa eventually leads to citizenship\n                            <\/p>\n<p>\n                                When someone obtains a Permanent Resident Visa, they get the right to live in the country for a specific period of time (5 years in case of Canada). They are still citizens of the other country; but now they are called permanent residents of the country they immigrated to. What&#8217;s important to note here is that a person with a study visa or work permit can also stay in the country for a specific time period but are not called Permanent Residents unless they acquire that visa after being eligible for the same.\n                            <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab my-4\">\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/Midas\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/canada-pr.webp\" alt=\"Canada PR Image\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n                        <\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab\">\n<h2 class=\"text-primary\">Eligibility for Canadian Permanent Resident Visa<\/h2>\n<p>\n                                Anyone can apply for Canadian PR but only those will be selected who are eligible:\n                            <\/p>\n<ul class=\"my-4\">\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Level of education<\/li>\n<li>Official language proficiency<\/li>\n<li>Second official language<\/li>\n<li>Canadian work experience<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<div class=\"service-info-tab my-4\">\n<h2 class=\"text-primary\">How Midas Touch can Help?<\/h2>\n<p>\n                                Of all visa applications, a Permanent Resident visa application can be very difficult to obtain.
